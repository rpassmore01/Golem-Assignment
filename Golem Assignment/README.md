#Golem Assignment
 
*This is a school project so the read me is a bit verbose.*

In the game you are initially greeted with an explanation of the game, but I will give a short explanation here.

There are a group of golems that want to take over the city, and you have been tasked to take them down. You can cast spells on them using 4 elements (Fire, Earth, Water and Air). Spells are cast in the following format "FEAW" or "FFAE". You must only input F,E,A or W, but you can do as many of each as you would like. There are only 4 letters in each combination. 

When the golems respond to your spell their eyes glow red for every letter that is in the correct location. Their eyes glow blue for every letter correctly included, but in the wrong location. An input of WEAE with a secret code of FFWE will yield an output of RB. 

You may opt in to hints when you start the game. These hints will give you a hint for a possible next guess. The hint will give you a possible input with the contraints given by the golem's response to your previous guess. The algorithms could be made better by determining which guess will cut down the remaining guesses the most, however the exsisting algorithm will still play better than most people. I plan to come back to this algorithm in the future to improve it. 

Thanks for playing!
